# Super SEO Spam Suppressor

Super SEO Spam Suppressor (SSSS[^SSSS]) is a domains blocklist of sites abusing SEO tactics to spam web searches with advertisement, empty content (monetized with ads) and malware (looking like ads). It is best used with uBlacklist or Search Engine Spam Blocker.

[^SSSS]: It's a Gridman reference. I'm spelling it out because it's also the name of a skin disease: don't go looking for SSSS on image search.

As of now, present day, time of writing year 2023, Google is now a terminally enshittified mess, merely a husk of the wonderful discovery tool it was yesterday.
Do you want to learn about *thing*?
How about **buying** *thing* and **consuming** *thing* instead?
Its drive to commercialize our every online interaction also has consequences on other, much more user friendly search engines such as DuckDuckGo, whose indexers crawl through shit optimized for Google's terrible algorithm.
This list is, as any good adblocking tool is, an attempt to escape this neverending capitalist coercition and attention theft.
All of the tech giants play this game so consider also using a social media blocklist.

## How to contribute

Clone this repository and add new domains in the appropriate `.txt` files in the `sources` folder. If you do not want to categorize, just put it in the `sources/default.txt` file and it will be blocked.

> For the `https://www.example.com` website, add `example.com` to the `sources/default.txt` file.

Then, when you push your changes to the `sources` folder, GitHub actions should kick in and automatically generate new versions of the blocklists. Should you want to generate them yourself, you can run the `scripts/update.sh` script (prerequisites : bash, python).

Finally, make a pull request: we'll review and approve it within a few days.

### Categorization

Blocked sites are organized using subfolders and `.txt` files in the `sources` folder. Use markdown (`.md`) files and comments (`#`) to add more information and references.

### How to contribute (easy mode)

If you have no idea how Git works, you can still contribute! Just [open an issue](https://github.com/NotaInutilis/Super-SEO-Spam-Suppressor/issues) with the URLs you would like to add to the list, grouping them by language and categories if possible. We'll check and add them shortly.

### Report malicious websites

The next best thing to do after adding a malicious website (malware, phishing, scam) to this list is to to report it so it actually doesn't show up in searches, or even gets taken offline by its host or registrar!
