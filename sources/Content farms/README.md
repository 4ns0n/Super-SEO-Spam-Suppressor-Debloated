Content farms are websites full of pure content: articles for the article throne.
They're looking for search engine clicks and views on their ads.
The boring articles go on for way too long, with unnecessary padding forced in every sentence because the writer is paid by the word/character.
They're currently being replaced by AIs.

Buying guides are what you're being fed whenever you're looking for any kind of information about appliances.
They're mainly writing product comparisons based on web stores listing, which they paraphrase with a dash of SEO.
There are no original pictures nor actual testing of the machine involved.
Their goal is to send users to an online store via affiliate links and earn a commission on each sale.
They're often published by advertisement companies while proudly touting their "independence".
